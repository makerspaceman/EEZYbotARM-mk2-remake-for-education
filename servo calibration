 * This is the Arduino code PAC6985 16 channel servo controller
 * watch the video for details (V1) and demo http://youtu.be/y8X9X10Tn1k
 *  This code is #2 for V2 Video Watch the video :https://youtu.be/bal2STaoQ1M
 *  I have got 3 codes as follow:
   #1-Arduino Code to run one by one all servos from 0 to 180Â°   
   #2-Arduino Code to control specific servos with specific angle
   #3-Arduino Code to run 2 or all servos at together
